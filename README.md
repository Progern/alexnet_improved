## How to use

### Google Colab

This project was primarly done in Google Colab so in order to use it in your Colab you need to (all links in the end of Readme):
- Clone the repo on your local machine
- Add the training and testing datasets to your Google Drive
- Change the *folder_location*, *alexnet_folder* and *data_location* values in IPython Notebook to your preferred values
- Change the Runtime of your Colab session to use GPU (**highly recommended**)
- Run the project, tune the model, do whatever for fun!

### Local machine

If you want to run this project on your local machine you need to:
- Clone the repo on your local machine
- Download the training and testing datasets from the provided Google Drive links
- Change the *folder_location*, *alexnet_folder* and *data_location* values in IPython Notebook to your system preferred values
- Prepare your GPU for battle
- Run & fun!
